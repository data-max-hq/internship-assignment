## Proposed Solution Details
- Time Complexity in Big-O notation: 
- Algorithm summary: 

## Task
Given two arrays (`array_a` and `array_b`) with integer numbers, 
write a function that returns an array containing all elements in both arrays without duplicates.

## Examples
### Example 1:
* `array_a = [1, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 65, 9, 7]`
* `array_b = [5, 6, 43, 8, 39, 74, 9, 100]`
* `Expected output should contain: [1, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 65, 9, 7, 5, 6, 43, 39, 74]`

## Requirements
- Use only arrays as data structures. Sets, trees or maps are not allowed.
- Ordering of elements in the returned array is *not* important.
- There are no duplicated elements in either arrays.
- Aim for an optimal solution.
- Avoid using predefined functions like `sort`, `min`, `max`, etc.
- Preferred programming languages: Java, C++, Python
